# Leadership Lessons from Scaling a PropTech Startup to 470% Growth

During my tenure as CEO of Operance (2016-2025), I had the privilege of building the company from a startup concept to a successful acquisition. This journey taught me invaluable lessons about leadership, strategic decision-making, and the unique challenges of scaling in the PropTech space. Here are the key insights that shaped our path to 470% revenue growth.

## The Foundation: Vision-Driven Leadership

**Clarity Above All Else**
The most critical early decision was establishing a clear, compelling vision that everyone could rally behind. In PropTech, where technological innovation meets traditional construction practices, this clarity becomes even more essential.

Our vision wasn't just about building software—it was about fundamentally transforming how the construction industry manages information and makes decisions.

## Strategic Decision Points That Defined Our Growth

### 1. Choosing the Right Market Entry Strategy

**Enterprise-First Approach**
Whilst many startups focus on small businesses for easier initial sales, we deliberately targeted enterprise customers from day one. This decision:
- Required longer sales cycles but resulted in higher LTV:CAC ratios (5.9x)
- Forced us to build robust, scalable solutions from the start
- Created stronger moats through deep integration and switching costs

### 2. Timing the Introduction of AI

**First-to-Market Advantage**
We made the strategic decision to integrate generative AI before it became mainstream in construction. This required:
- Significant R&D investment when resources were constrained
- Convincing conservative industry players to adopt cutting-edge technology
- Building internal AI expertise whilst the talent market was competitive

The payoff was substantial—our AI-first features became a primary differentiator that accelerated our growth trajectory.

### 3. Building the Right Team at the Right Time

**Scaling Challenges**
One of the most difficult aspects of rapid growth was building team capacity whilst maintaining culture and quality:

**Technical Team Scaling**
- Hired senior architects early to establish technical foundations
- Invested heavily in code quality and documentation
- Implemented robust testing and deployment practices

**Sales and Customer Success**
- Built a consultative sales approach suitable for long enterprise cycles
- Developed deep domain expertise within the sales team
- Created scalable onboarding and customer success processes

### 4. Achieving Operational Excellence

**ESG Leadership**
Our commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance initiatives resulted in achieving a 4-star Governance score (the highest possible) within one year, demonstrating that rapid growth and responsible business practices can coexist.

**Remote Team Success**
Growing from 5 to 19 employees whilst maintaining a fully remote culture required:
- Robust policies and clear guidance
- Investment in team cohesion through company retreats
- Implementation of internal AI chatbots for knowledge sharing

## Navigating Industry-Specific Challenges

### Cultural Change Management

The construction industry's resistance to change required a unique approach:

**Gradual Value Demonstration**
- Started with familiar use cases before introducing revolutionary features
- Provided extensive training and support during implementation
- Celebrated early wins to build momentum within client organisations

**Building Trust Through Results**
- Focused on measurable ROI from day one
- Developed case studies showcasing concrete improvements
- Maintained transparent communication about both successes and challenges

## Financial Discipline During Hypergrowth

### Balancing Growth and Profitability

Achieving 470% revenue growth (from £82K to £472K) whilst maintaining financial discipline required:

**Strategic Investment Priorities**
1. Product development and AI capabilities
2. Enterprise sales team expansion
3. Customer success and retention programmes
4. Strategic partnerships and integrations

**Capital Efficiency**
- Maintained lean operations where possible
- Focused on high-impact marketing channels
- Optimised customer acquisition costs through referral programmes
- Achieved industry-leading 46-day DSO (Days Sales Outstanding)

## Key Lessons for Future Leaders

### 1. Embrace the Long Game
PropTech sales cycles are extended, but the payoff in terms of customer lifetime value and market position is significant. Patience and persistence are essential. Our average sales cycle was 70 days, but we achieved £20K lifetime value per customer.

### 2. Domain Expertise is Non-Negotiable
Success in construction technology requires deep understanding of industry workflows, pain points, and decision-making processes. As a Chartered Civil Engineer with 25+ years in the industry, this expertise proved invaluable.

### 3. Technology Must Solve Real Problems
Avoid the temptation to build technology for technology's sake. Every feature should address a specific, measurable problem that customers are willing to pay to solve. Our focus on saving 1.5 hours per day in productivity resonated deeply with customers.

### 4. Culture Scales or Breaks
As we grew to serve 470 active organisations across 158 sites and projects, maintaining our culture of innovation, customer focus, and quality became both more challenging and more critical.

## Preparing for the Next Chapter

The successful acquisition represents not an endpoint, but a transition to the next phase of growth and impact. The lessons learned from this journey—about leadership, market positioning, team building, and strategic execution—continue to inform my approach to technology leadership.

For leaders embarking on similar journeys in PropTech or other traditional industries ripe for disruption, remember that success comes from the intersection of technological innovation, deep domain expertise, and disciplined execution.
