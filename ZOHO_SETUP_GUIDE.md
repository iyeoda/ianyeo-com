```

## Step 2: Zoho Bookings Setup (Embedded Widget Solution)

**IMPORTANT UPDATE:** Due to Zoho Bookings API scope limitations (only `zohobookings.data.CREATE` available), we've implemented a proven embedded widget solution that provides all the benefits without the API complexity.

### 2.1 Enable Zoho Bookings
1. Go to [https://bookings.zoho.com](https://bookings.zoho.com)
2. Sign in with your Zoho account
3. Set up your Bookings workspace
4. Choose your subscription plan (Basic or higher recommended for professional features)

### 2.2 Create Your Booking Service
1. In Zoho Bookings, go to **Services** â†’ **Add Service**
2. Create a service with these settings:
   - **Service Name**: "AI Strategy Consultation"
   - **Duration**: 30 minutes
   - **Description**: "Free 30-minute strategy call to discuss AI opportunities for your business"
   - **Category**: "Consultations"
   - **Buffer Time**: 15 minutes before/after (optional)

3. Set your **Availability**:
   - Go to **Availability** settings
   - Set your working hours (e.g., Mon-Fri 9 AM - 5 PM)
   - Configure time slots (e.g., every 30 minutes)
   - Set timezone to your location

4. Configure **Booking Settings**:
   - Enable **"Allow customers to book online"**
   - Set **"Maximum advance booking"** (e.g., 30 days)
   - Set **"Minimum advance booking"** (e.g., 2 hours)
   - Enable **"Send confirmation emails"**
   - Enable **"Send reminder emails"**

### 2.3 Get Your Booking Page URL
1. In Zoho Bookings, go to **Settings** â†’ **Booking Page**
2. Copy your booking page URL (e.g., `https://bookings.zoho.com/portal/yourname`)
3. Test the booking page to ensure it works correctly

### 2.4 Customize Your Booking Page (Optional)
1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Booking Page** â†’ **Customize**
2. Upload your logo and set brand colors
3. Add custom welcome message and instructions
4. Configure required booking fields (name, email, phone, etc.)
5. Set up email templates with your branding

### 2.5 Configure Email Templates
1. In Zoho Bookings, go to **Settings** â†’ **Email Templates**
2. Customize the confirmation email template:

3. Set up reminder emails:
   - 24 hours before meeting

### 2.6 Website Integration Methods

- âœ… Works perfectly on all devices

### 2.7 Test the Complete Flow

### 2.8 CRM Integration (Automatic)
When someone books through Zoho Bookings:
1. **Contact Creation**: Automatically creates/updates contact in Zoho CRM
2. **High-Value Lead Scoring**: Booking leads get 95 points (vs 30 for assessments)
3. **Activity Tracking**: Meeting scheduled activity is logged
4. **Email Automation**: Welcome series and follow-up emails are triggered
5. **Calendar Sync**: Appointment appears in your connected calendars
6. **Reminder System**: Automated reminders reduce no-shows

This solution provides all the benefits of API integration while avoiding the technical complexity and scope limitations.

## Step 3: Zoho Campaigns Setup

### 3.1 Enable Zoho Campaigns
1. Go to [https://campaigns.zoho.com](https://campaigns.zoho.com)
2. Set up your account
3. Verify your domain/sender address

### 3.2 Create Mailing Lists
Create these three lists for lead segmentation:
- **high-value-prospects** (Lead Score â‰¥ 70)
- **qualified-leads** (Lead Score 50-69)
- **general-leads** (Lead Score < 50)

### 3.3 Set Up Email Sequences
For each list, create automated email sequences:

**High-Value Prospects (5 emails over 2 weeks):**
1. Welcome + Strategy consultation invite
2. Enterprise AI case study
3. ROI calculator and implementation guide
4. Personal video message
5. Follow-up consultation offer

**Qualified Leads (4 emails over 3 weeks):**
1. Welcome + assessment results
2. Getting started guide
3. Success stories
4. Consultation offer

**General Leads (3 emails over 4 weeks):**
1. Welcome + educational content
2. AI basics for construction
3. Free resources and next steps

### 3.4 Get OAuth Refresh Token
1. Go to [https://api-console.zoho.com](https://api-console.zoho.com)
2. Click "Add Client" â†’ "Self Client"
3. Enter client name: "AI Consultancy Campaigns Integration"
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 3.5 Generate Campaigns Refresh Token
```bash
# Step 1: Get authorization code (replace CLIENT_ID with your actual ID)
https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/auth?scope=ZohoCampaigns.contact.ALL,ZohoCampaigns.campaign.ALL&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&access_type=offline&redirect_uri=https://ianyeo.com

# Step 2: Exchange for refresh token
curl -X POST https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "redirect_uri=https://ianyeo.com" \
  -d "code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE"
```

**Note:** You can use the same Client ID/Secret from CRM setup since Zoho allows one Self Client application per account.

## Step 4: Cloudflare Worker Secrets

Set these secrets using `wrangler secret put`:

```bash
# Zoho CRM (Required for lead capture and assessment)
wrangler secret put ZOHO_CRM_CLIENT_SECRET  
wrangler secret put ZOHO_CRM_REFRESH_TOKEN

# Zoho Campaigns (Optional - for email automation)
wrangler secret put ZOHO_CAMPAIGNS_REFRESH_TOKEN

# Core functionality (already configured)
wrangler secret put ZOHO_API_KEY              # ZeptoMail for transactional emails
wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY      # Cloudflare Turnstile for form protection

# Optional: Google Analytics (if keeping)
wrangler secret put GA4_API_SECRET
```

**Note:** Zoho Bookings secrets are no longer needed since we're using the embedded widget approach instead of API integration.

## Step 5: Test the Integration

### 5.1 Test Lead Capture
1. Submit the assessment form on your landing page
2. Verify contact appears in Zoho CRM
3. Check that welcome email is sent via ZeptoMail

   ```
   
4. **Verify Button Click Tracking**:

### General OAuth Issues

**Problem: "Invalid client" errors**
- âœ… Double-check your Client ID and Client Secret
- âœ… Ensure the OAuth application is active in Zoho API Console
- âœ… Verify the redirect URI exactly matches what you configured

**Problem: Token refresh failures**
- âœ… Check that you requested the correct scopes during authorization

- âœ… Try the manual token refresh process to debug

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test Zoho Bookings connectivity
curl https://ianyeo.com/api/debug/test-all

# Check what services are available
curl https://ianyeo.com/api/bookings/services

# Test a specific date's availability (replace SERVICE_ID)
curl "https://ianyeo.com/api/bookings/availability?service_id=YOUR_SERVICE_ID&date=2024-01-15"

wrangler tail
```

## Next Steps

2. Configure OAuth applications and get refresh tokens
3. Set the Cloudflare Worker secrets
4. Test each integration individually
5. Deploy and test the complete flow
6. Set up analytics and monitoring
